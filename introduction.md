# Introduction
## Who am I?
- Steven Schwenke

## Who are you?
- What do you expect from me? What topics, technologies, experiences do you want to hear about?
- (maybe first assignment) Why are you studying computer science? What's your motivation? What do you think your job will feel like later on?
- What do you think is the major challenge in modern software development?
- how well do you know what language (especially Java because many examples will be written in Java)

## Requirements and Goals of this course
- copy from README.md

## The course
- English or German?
- slides will be in English because that's the language of software development

## Meta
Agreements for this course: 
- no compulsory attendance. If you stay, be quite and listen.
- questions everytime, not just in the end
- questions also via Github: create issue with [tag "question"](https://github.com/stevenschwenke/SoftwareEngineeringCourse/labels/question)
- bring your own device - whatever fits your needs
- sorry, I will sometimes speak to you on a first-name basis (standard in modern IT companies)

## Why software engineering?
- "software is eating the world"
- software is main business value today
- automobiles are driving computers, not machines that happen to have computers on board
- what I learned during my studies: analytical and structured thinking. technical details of this course will be legacy when you're about to use them. Focus on the concepts.
 
## Assignments
- create motivational balance sheet for your choice to study computer science (Management 3.0, page 85)
