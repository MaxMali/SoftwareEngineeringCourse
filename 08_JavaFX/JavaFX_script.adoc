* ___Important note to Speaker:___ _principles not explained in detail yet. Students have to read up by themselves! This will be in the test._


* principle separation of concerns: Separation FXML, Java, CSS
* SceneGraph as a practical application of Trees
* composite pattern: components using the container-concept
* practical application of inheritance: everything is a Node, but not everything is a Parent
* Inversion of Control:
** Swing code generators: "protected regions". Changing these will cause the generator to fail to open this file.
** JavaFX:
*** platform uses annotations in controllers as hooks for events and for wiring everything together
*** possible to manually program node hierarchy AND have it "drawn" using SceneBuilder
** Inversion of Control: "instead of being dependent on the generated code, the generated code becomes dependent on the handcrafted presenter"
** also: Hollywood principle: "Don't call us, we call you!"
