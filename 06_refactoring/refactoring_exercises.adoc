= Refactoring

== Definition
. What is "refactoring"?

== Principles in Refactoring
. State and describe 3 of the 5 principles in Refactoring.

== Code smells as a source for refactoring
. State and describe 8 of the 16 code smells.
. Make a list of as many different code smells in the ugly trivia game as you can find.
. Propose a refactoring for each code smell and describe its implementation.

== Small Refactorings
. State 2 reasons for the refactoring "extract method".
. When applying the refactoring "inline method", what important circumstance has to be checked before refactoring?
. Write a short (!) code snippet or pseudo code snippet to illustrate
    1. when to use "introduce explaining variable" and
    2. when not to.
    (Hint: You have to write two short code snippets)
. What is the refactoring "Remove assignments to parameters"? Why is it a good idea to do that?
. Under which circumstances should "extract class" be applied?
. What does "Replace data value with object" do? Why is it a good idea to do so?
. There are refactorings "Change unidirectional association to bidirectional" and "Change bidirectional association with unidirectional". What is a unidirectional, what a bidirectional association?
. What is a magic number? State one! (With an example - not just a number ;) )
