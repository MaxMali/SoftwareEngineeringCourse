== General
* current major version: 5

image::repository.png[]

* great source for learning: https://github.com/msg-DAVID-GmbH/JUnit-5-Quick-Start-Guide-with-AssertJ-Spring-TestFX-Mockito[msg DAVID JUnit 5 Start Guide]
* a lot of different kinds of tests. Most important:
** unit tests
** integration tests
** smoke tests
* Motivation for writing tests
** "old understanding": tests as proof for correctness of code
** more modern view: Test-Driven Development (TDD)
** exploration tests
** tests as tool for debugging
** tests as documentation

== TDD Test Cycle

== Demo
* demonstration:
** implementing rules for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life[Game of Life] TDD-style in a new project
** good best practice: first develop functionality in tests, then move to other classes
** test coverage in general and analysis in IntelliJ IDEA

* intentionally breaking test makes Travis run red

== Conclusion
*TESTS ARE IMPORTANT!* Write them.
