### Additional lectures

Additional to the normal lectures, there will be two block sessions on

* Saturday, 2019-12-14
** goal: enhance your skills in on of the most important and basic aspects of software engineering: programming 
** Clean Code in theory
** Clean Code in practice by Coderetreat (Game of Life)
* Saturday, 2019-12-21

The content of these sessions will __not__ be relevant for the exam. However, I strongly recommend visiting the sessions to benefit from the additional content.
