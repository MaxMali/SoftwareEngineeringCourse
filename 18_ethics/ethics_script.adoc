== Motivation
=== Joseph Weizenbaum
* during studies, heard https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ssks6y7Xskw[this speech ] from Joseph Weizenbaum in Magdeburg
* worked on Arpanet, successor of internet
* wrote ELIZA, successor of modern chatbots
* variant of ELIZA: "doctor", simulating psychotherapist
* people told "doctor" intimate details - Weizenbaum shocked by that - just a computer program!
* told story in talk: student asked him if development of camera recognition in soft toys. Answer: "What do you think can this technology be used for alternatively?"
* made me think different about my role as a developer

=== "Ethical questions" of self-driving cars
* from Chaos Computer Club and others
* "What do we want: a machine killing one child or a machine killing three adult men?"
* also: person programming this algorithm is deciding fate of potentially thousands of people!
* at that time, didn't understand the importance of this
* now: Tesla. Question is not current, it's obsolete!

=== VW Diesel
image::VW_Tiguan_engine.jpg[]
* Bosch control units providing a reasonable functionality (shutting down cleaning of exhaust fumes) used by VW to bypass environmental controls
* very complex topic, no details here
* important: programmers / software engineers / hardware engineers provided functionality that has been misused by other people, causing lethal damage to innocent people.
* "fact": most likely, people actually died!

== Aspects of Ethics in Software Engineering

=== Licensing
* https://choosealicense.com/licenses/[ChooseALicense.com] - huge number of licenses!
* because of that: often unnoticed in new (open source) projects + default "all mine!"
* other side, using software: violation of licences (automatic header creation "everything owned by MyCompany Inc.")

=== Data
* Who of you uses WhatsApp?
* Who of you would give the BND or NSA his name and telephone number?
** = unapproved data transfer of personal and individualizing data of friends + family
* data transfer to other services (WhatsApp is owned by Facebook)
** = undesired transfer of data to third parties
* Alexa
** a couple of decades ago, German authorities broke into apartments to install microphones behind the wallpapers
** nowadays, people are paying for this
** maybe unaware that speech processing happens on the servers?

=== Algorithms and functionality
* see control units Bosch VW Diesel
* If a dictator asks you to write a software that identifies anonymously created accounts in social platforms to find "terrorists" - would you implement this?
* at a former employer: team next door developing software for managing medical animal testing. Didn't know that - shocked me.
* main appeal: Think about what you develop!

=== Plain Security
* BSI (German NSA) two roles: Trojan in every device + IT security. Not compatible!
* Are you developing an admin access or a backdoor?

=== Many more ...
* for example machine learning
* there will be more in the future - stay vigilant!

== Who is responsible?
* simple answer: *YOU ARE!*
* Software Developers have a very important job and decide very important things. Be aware of that and act accordingly!

== What is at stake?
* Peoples freedom, dignity and lives.
* Don't let anybody tell you "It's not that bad, relax."
* Read history books.

== Recommendations
* Cory Doctorow
* Joseph Weizenbaum (videos)
