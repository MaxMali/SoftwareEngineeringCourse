image::goals.png[]
- getting an overview about what modern software development is
- getting to know SOME current methods, tools and processes that are used in today's industry
- getting a feeling what it means to be a software craftsman (maybe even deciding if you want to become one or not)

=== What this course is NOT about
image::whatItsNotAbout.png[]
- becoming an expert in a specific programming language, although there will be sessions that have a lot of code
- deep-dive into theoretical scientific computer science, it's more about the everyday work as an engineer
- complete and correct and top-notch state-of-the-art in-depth study of modern software development - that doesn't exist

== Requirements

- understanding written and spoken english language
- being able to read Java code (you don't need to be an expert, just know the basics)
- fundamentals of OOP

== I won't be around for long :)
- ... just this semester
- if you repeat this course, it will look very different!

== Rules
image::rules.png[]
* Be on time.
That's 80% of success later on.
* Immediately ask questions.
* Immediately make remarks about possible errors.
* PRs are welcome!

== How to get through this course

* (experiences from last year)
* no physical presence required -> however, leads to bad results in test - don't know why
* test:
** no coding!
However, really understanding the covered code necessary
** challenge: a lot of material to cover, however no deep-dives
** Write very, very readable!
Last year one person failing because of non-readable handwriting
** If this is your last try for the test:
It IS DOABLE. However, please please please do learn for it.
** exercises-files are for you to work with - most of the questions for the test are already there!
