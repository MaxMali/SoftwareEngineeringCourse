== Waterfall

image::waterfall-agile_teaser.png[]

* see __left side and center__ of _Waterfall vs Agile CheatSheet (by Development that pays)_


* early days of creating software: no best practices, many different approaches
* formal approaches
* software development = engineering with models, methods, frameworks, ...
* much bureaucracy and paperwork that slowed development down
* in cheat sheet: standard waterfall. However, V-model exists: specify tests for each phase during this phase
* missing in cheat sheet: maintenance phase
** = "basically finished, but a lot of missing features"
** = conceptually agile
** in reality, there is no maintenance phase because development goes on
* waterfall assumes
** customer knows exact requirements beforehand
** customers wishes don't change between start of project and release
** every last detail can be thought of beforehand, without starting to "think in implementation mode"
* HOWEVER: waterfall is not dead!
    - certificated software: certification = requirements
    - software that definitively is not changed (deep-space probes)

== "Agile"
* "agile" = new word for old virtues
* result of development that took decades:
** early 1990s: Rapid Application Development (RAD) = some formal methods + prototyping, evolutionary delivery, customer collaboration
** Scrum (1995)
** Feature Driven Development (1999)
** Pragmatic Programming (1999)
** 2001: Agile manifesto

* empirical process control: transparency + inspect + adapt. Basically: "get knowledge from your experiences and adapt your actions"

* see __center and right side__ of _Waterfall vs Agile CheatSheet (by Development that pays)_
* most-encountered real-world problem: waterfall-management cannot accept iterative process that simply cannot enforce a deadline.

== Scrum
* "Scrum" from Rugby
* perfect team size = 6 +- 3
* https://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum/core-scrum-values-roles[scrum values], based on agile manifesto:
** focus (on sprint goal)
** courage
** openness
** commitment (don't promise something you know you cannot deliver)
** respect
* Scrum in one image:

* implementation of "inspect" in Scrum:
** Daily = inspect work of last 24 hours
** Review = inspect work of last sprint
** Retrospective = inspect processes, tools and behavior
* timeboxes (2 week sprint):
** Planning: 4 hours
** Daily: 15 minutes (0.25h x 10 = 2.5h per sprint)
** Review: 2 hours
** Retro: 2 hours
** = 10.5h / sprint = <14% of time of sprint (without grooming meeting!)
* standard questions for retrospective:
** What went well?
** What do we want to improve?
** What did we learn?
** What is it that we don't understand yet? (Joseph Pelrine)
* velocity
** = amount of story points of finished user stories per sprint
** in theory: good metric for planning
** however, often source of arguments:
*** as always, no guarantee to finish promised stories
*** comparison between teams not possible (story of competitor who had two times the story points we had, hence loss of project)
*** often used metric for fixed price contracts, but very problematic
