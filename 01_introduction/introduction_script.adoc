- getting an overview about what modern software development is
- getting to know SOME current methods, tools and processes that are used in today's industry

=== What this course is NOT about
image::whatItsNotAbout.png[]
- becoming an expert in a specific programming language, although there will be sessions that have a lot of code
- deep-dive into theoretical scientific computer science, it's more about the everyday work as an engineer
- complete and correct and top-notch state-of-the-art in-depth study of modern software development - that doesn't exist

== Requirements

== I won't be around for long :)

- if you repeat this course, it will look very different!
