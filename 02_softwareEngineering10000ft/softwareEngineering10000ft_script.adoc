== Biological Approach to Software engineering
image::biologicalApproach.png[]

- unpredictable process
- complex, not just complicated
- process of developing software = scientific biology survey
- uncertainty theory of software development: either know __when__ a software releases or __what__ it will do (never both)
- one cause of unpredictability: human factor ("Es menschelt") - no model can eliminate that, except for Cyberdyne Systems

image::architectureComparison.png[]
- often-cited comparison: building architecture => not really good comparison
- instead of producing / building something: You never know what will be the result and when it will be there
- => "building" is so fast nowadays, a lot of programmers don't even notice it ("build"-step)

== Elements of software engineering
image::elementsOfSoftwareEngineering.png[]

* programming languages
** web-ish:
*** Java Script - family (everything ending with "JS")
** OOP:
*** Java extremely interesting because of distribution, active community and evolution of the language itself
*** C#, C++
** mobile
*** Swift
** hardware
*** Assembler
*** C
* community, conferences, Hackathons, user groups, ...
** Do yourself a favor and have a look at http://ithubbs.de/[IT Hub Braunschweig]!
* models and best practices
** MVC
** Domain Driven Design
** TDD
** Clean Code
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)[SOLID] = single responsibility principle + open/closed principle + Liskov Substitution Principle + Interface Segregation Principle + Dependency Inversion
* tools
** technical
*** IDEs
*** version control
*** building tools
*** analysis
** platforms
** just "google-driven-development" bad idea
** however: of course use stackoverflow, GitHub and Google!
** _show stackoverflow!_
** important to understand what you googled before applying it
* processes
** waterfall
** agile (Scrum, Kanban)
** project management
* soft skills - Do yourself a favor and develop them!
** important to know how to learn (you should know this by now)
** tolerance for difficult situations like debugging for 2 days
** technology = foundation of success in software engineering, but not enough

*** 7 top characteristics of success:
**** being a good coach
**** communicating and listening well
**** possessing insights into others (including others different values and points of view)
**** having empathy toward and being supportive of oneâ€™s colleagues
**** being a good critical thinker and problem solver
**** and being able to make connections across complex ideas
*** best teams range of soft skills:
**** equality
**** generosity
**** curiosity toward the ideas of your teammates
**** empathy
**** emotional intelligence
**** emotional safety

== Software engineering can be handled
image::noSilverBullet.png[]
- no silver bullet for problems
- over the decades a ton of methods, processes and models
- working, but dependent on circumstances
- because of relatively young branch emerging new concepts

== Opportunities
image::whatWillYouMakeOfThis.png[]
- because of all this: highly dynamic, omnipresent key-branch with huge opportunities
- favorite examples: 
    - Apple: "Let's sell the people the music they want to hear instead of hunting the leechers"
    - Tesla: "Let's think of a car as a moving computer!"
    - remote working movement
    - "thinking IT"
