== JavaFX basics - practical use
Write a JavaFX application that implements a party planer. Dependent on the number of guests (which can be entered using a text field), a shopping list (displayed in a text area) should be generated with all the items needed for the event. The list has to include at least the items "beer" and "chips". Additionally, the intensity of the party has to be selectable (via a combobox). There should be at least the intensities "well-behaved" and "wild".

Example 1: The user enters the typical data for a small LAN party: 6 guests and intensity "well-behaved". The generated list includes 0 beer and 6 chips.
   
Example 2: The user enters the typical data for a medium student kitchen party: 25 guests and intensity "wild". The generated list includes 50 beer and 18 chips.
   
Note: The calculating factor from the number of guests + intensity for calculating the amount of items is not given. Use your own factors.
 
Feel free to expand your application for your own practical use. ;)
