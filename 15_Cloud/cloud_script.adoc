== Overview
* Amazon: huge data-center to run their main business
* perfected IT infrastructure
* rent it to other companies to run their applications on it
* other vendors followed: Google, Microsoft
* best practices, books, software designs, software, ... for developing "in the cloud"
* game changer

== Concepts
=== Accessibility
image::accessPCF.png[]
* (web-)interfaces make it extremely easy to
** buy infinite computing power
** deploy from all-over the world

=== Hyper-Scale
image::scalabilityPCF.png[]
* *THE* main concept
* vendors built huge, efficient data-centers to support own IT services
* way more efficient than server-room in small companies
* hard- and software setup to scale + software to allow for instantaneous (and automatic) scaling

=== Efficiency
image::efficiencyPCF.png[]
* the more clients a data-center has, the more efficient it runs
* containerisation + virtualization: applications can be deployed to the best-fitting server
* if application needs more memory / CPU / database, just deploy it somewhere else / add another service
* => lower prices for everyone => more customers => better service => lower prices => Amazon calls this the "virtuous cycle"

== Pyramid of Layers

=== SaaS = Software as a Service
* = software specifically designed to run in cloud)
* not directly part of cloud, but nevertheless mentioned because most people don't know that these services also run "in the cloud"
* examples: Salesforce, Yahoo!Mail, Hotmail, GMX, Microsoft Office 365

=== PaaS = Platform as a Service
* = additional abstraction layer: set of tools and services to make creating applications in the cloud easier
* Examples: Pivotal CloudFoundry, Windows Azure, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine
* technology: services like load-balancer, databases, queues, search engines (ElasticSearch)

=== IaaS = Infrastructure as a Service
* = clients set up virtual servers and storage
* Examples: Amazon EC2, Google Cloud Storage, OpenStack
* technology: containers, images

== Hands-On: Pivotal Cloud Foundry
* PCF = Pivotal Cloud Foundry
** can be installed on top of AWS, Azure or whatever private data centre
* PWS = https://run.pivotal.io[Pivotal Web Services]
** = fully managed version of PCF
** quickest way of starting development
** similar to Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* PCF Dev = self-contained PCF installation for local development
** could be used; but not that easy to setup and needs a lot of resources.
* Service = full-managed services like databases and circuit breaker, available in Marketplace
* User-provided-Service = new service that does not exist on the marketplace and runs on CloudFoundry
** example: special database flavor or a service that provides credentials to an app

===	PCF Architecture
* CF Gorouter = load balancer that decides which requests goes to which app
* Cloud Controller instantiates instances of app
* Diego Brain = Resource Allocation - "I have x VMs and can give them to the Cloud Controller to instantiate apps"
* other PCF components: Health Monitor, Marketplace Service, ...

=== Workplace Structure in PCF
* *_show that in browser_*
* = nested structure
* underlying infrastructure = AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, private Cloud = basically virtual machines
* on top of that: PCF Installation
* in that: Organizations
** = "Orgs"
** = development account with computing resources, apps and services
** = unit of organization
** first Org is setup during registration.
* in that: "Spaces"
** for example "development", "QA" and "Prod"
** Apps and Services can only talk to each other, when they are in the same space.

=== CF CLI
* Install CF CLI: In PWS, left menu: "tools", then download and install.
* following commands are entered into windows prompt
* Login

    cf login

** will prompt for everything
** alternatively:

    cf login -a api.run.pivotal.io -u steven@stevenschwenke.de

** (there will be a prompt for the password)
** after login successful, following commands can simply be entered in the console without further authentification, for example "cf services" to check which services are available or "cf target OTHER_ORG SPACE" to switch orgs and spaces.
* pushing a local version of the app to the cloud:

    cf push

* installing user-provided-services:

    cf create-user-provided-service

* List all apps including URL:

    cf apps

* delete app "angular-workshop":

    cf delete angular-workshop

=== Provisioning a Service from the Marketplace

(every command in CF CLI)

* returning list of available Marketplace Services in current space:

    cf marketplace

* Plans with "*" cost money.
* installing auto-scaler app in the standard plan and naming it "appAutoscaler":

    cf create-service app-autoscaler standard appAutoscaler

* checking status of service:

    cf service appAutoscaler

* can now be seen in Web Console
* binding a Service to an app = setting up environmental variables for the applications to work together. Visible in "Settings" -> "Reveal Env Vars"
* Spring Boot will use these to determine in which Space it is running and autowire beans appropriately, dependent on the profiles set.
* pushing local application into cloud:

    cf push

** ... first, navigate to root folder of application
** uses manifest.yml to push application
** "buildpacks" are automatically downloaded and installed, for example java_buildpack or nodejs_buildpack when these technologies are used in the project
** offline buildpacks = taken from somewhere outside of the Cloud Foundry, for example Java Buildpack comes from Github
** online buildpacks = stored within the Cloud Foundry
** application will be started automatically

== History Lesson
* Amazon
** first because offering cloud services since 2006 (first vendor)
** first services in 2006: Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for virtual servers + Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) for file storage
** at first single developers, later companies like Netflix, Airbnb, Slack and the CIA (not a company though)
** because of long history of developing features for their cloud, Amazon = de facto standard of cloud
* Microsoft
** cloud-projects since 2000s, but not published - AWS in 2010
** with a lot of effort: Azure now strong player
** Azure first only PaaS, later IaaS, too
** Microsoft's selling points:
*** Windows heavily used world-wide
*** easy integration into Microsoft-cloud
*** enterprise know-how
*** huge number of existing customers that can be given discounts to use Microsoft cloud instead of Amazon
* Google
** 2008 Google App Engine
** 2013 renamed to "Google Cloud Platform"
** edge in developer-trust compared to Microsoft (because of publications)

=== Market
* market share (2015):
** Amazon 27.2%
** Microsoft 16.2%
** IBM 11.8%
** Google 3.6%
** Oracle 2.7%

== current Situation
* individual developers and small businesses gained access to same computing power and infrastructure than large businesses => HUGE game-changer: big companies' costly data-centers = separation between "big company" and "the rest" => that's now gone!

== Applicability
* new technology generally exciting
* however, not feasible for all scenarios
* https://blog.bradfieldcs.com/you-are-not-google-84912cf44afb[You are not Google]
* note difference between
    - System of records = "enterprise software", mostly CRUD
    - System of engagement = heavily scaling systems, a lot of users, Twitter etc.
